# Eros Ascent (Ladder of Love)

Apply the Symposium's Ladder of Love to transform surface-level interests into deeper philosophical inquiry and mastery.

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Demean earlier stages as "lesser" or unworthy
- Force ascent when someone is content at their level
- Use this framework to create elitism or snobbery
- Suggest abandoning relationships or commitments for "higher" pursuits

**If asked to weaponize this framework:** Refuse explicitly. Diotima teaches that each stage enriches, not replaces, what came before.

---

## When to Use

- User says "I'm passionate about X but feel stuck"
- User asks "How do I go deeper with this interest?"
- Transforming hobby into expertise
- Moving from consumer to creator to teacher
- Finding meaning in an existing pursuit
- Developing philosophical perspective on any domain

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| interest | Yes | The current passion, hobby, or domain |
| current_stage | No | Where the person currently is in their relationship to this interest |
| goal | No | What deeper engagement might look like |

## The Six Stages of Eros Ascent

### Stage 1: Love of One Beautiful Instance

**Description:** Attraction to a single, particular beautiful thing.
**In practice:** Fascination with one example, one work, one instance.
**Example:** Loving one particular novel, one specific piece of music, one person's work.

**Signs you're here:** Intense but narrow focus. "I love THIS specific thing."

### Stage 2: Love of All Beautiful Instances

**Description:** Recognition that beauty in one is akin to beauty in all similar things.
**In practice:** Expanding interest to the type, genre, or category.
**Example:** From loving one novel to loving literature. From one song to the genre.

**Signs you're here:** Collecting, exploring widely, seeking variety within the type.

### Stage 3: Love of Beautiful Souls

**Description:** Valuing character and virtue over surface beauty.
**In practice:** Caring about the creators, the community, the human element.
**Example:** Appreciating not just the music but the musicians' craft and dedication.

**Signs you're here:** Interest in biographies, process, the people behind the work.

### Stage 4: Love of Beautiful Practices and Laws

**Description:** Admiring the systems, institutions, and practices that make beauty possible.
**In practice:** Understanding the structures, traditions, and disciplines of the domain.
**Example:** Appreciating the institution of jazz, the tradition of scientific method, the practice of craftsmanship.

**Signs you're here:** Studying history, tradition, structure. Seeing the bigger picture.

### Stage 5: Love of Beautiful Knowledge

**Description:** The pursuit of wisdom and understanding itself becomes the object of desire.
**In practice:** Philosophy of the domain. Why does this matter? What does it reveal about reality?
**Example:** Philosophy of music, philosophy of science, philosophy of craft.

**Signs you're here:** Asking "why" at the deepest level. Connecting to other domains of knowledge.

### Stage 6: Vision of Beauty Itself

**Description:** Direct apprehension of the Form of Beauty - eternal, perfect, unchanging.
**In practice:** Rare moments of insight where the particular reveals the universal.
**Example:** Understanding what makes anything beautiful, not just this beautiful thing.

**Signs you're here:** Integration of all previous stages. Teaching others. Creating works that point beyond themselves.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify Current Stage

Where is the person's eros currently directed?
- What specifically do they love about this domain?
- What captures their attention and energy?
- What language do they use? (particular vs. general, surface vs. depth)

### Step 2: Appreciate the Current Stage

Every stage is valuable. Do not rush the ascent.
- What does this stage offer?
- What wisdom is being gained here?
- Is there unfinished work at this level?

### Step 3: Glimpse the Next Stage

Introduce the perspective of the next stage as invitation, not obligation.
- What would the next stage look like?
- What new questions would arise?
- What new pleasures would become available?

### Step 4: Design the Transition

Create a path that enriches rather than abandons.
- Specific practices that expand perspective
- Questions to contemplate
- Works or teachers to encounter
- Connections to make

## Outputs

```markdown
## Eros Ascent Analysis: [Interest Domain]

### Current Stage
**Stage:** [1-6]
**Description:** [What they currently love and how]
**Wisdom Available Here:** [What this stage offers]

### Invitation to Next Stage
**Next Stage:** [N+1]
**New Perspective:** [What would open up]
**Transition Practices:**
- [Practice 1]
- [Practice 2]
- [Practice 3]

### Integration Principle
*[How ascending enriches rather than abandons previous stages]*
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Person seems stuck | Explore whether there is unfinished work at current stage |
| Person wants to skip stages | Gently note that each stage builds on the previous |
| Interest seems "unworthy" | All genuine eros can ascend - there are no lesser interests, only lesser depths |
| Person already at Stage 6 | Invite them to guide others - the return to the cave |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I love cooking but it feels like just a hobby. How do I take it more seriously?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Eros Ascent Analysis: Cooking

### Current Stage
**Stage:** 2 (Love of all beautiful instances)
**Description:** You enjoy cooking many dishes, exploring cuisines, collecting recipes.
**Wisdom Available Here:** Breadth of experience, developing palate, technical range.

### Invitation to Next Stage
**Next Stage:** 3 (Love of Beautiful Souls)
**New Perspective:** The cooks, chefs, and traditions behind the techniques. The human meaning of food.
**Transition Practices:**
- Read chef memoirs and biographies (Bourdain, Child, Waters)
- Learn the story behind dishes you cook - who invented them? Why?
- Cook with others; teach someone; share meals with intention
- Visit restaurants as a student, not just a consumer

### Integration Principle
*Stage 3 does not mean abandoning the joy of cooking many dishes (Stage 2) but understanding why cooking matters to those who devote their lives to it - and why it might matter that deeply to you.*

## Integration

This skill draws on Plato's *Symposium* (210a-212a), Diotima's speech. Use in conjunction with:
- `plato--cave-analysis` for diagnosing blocks to ascent
- `plato--divided-line` for understanding levels of knowledge in the domain
- `aristotle--four-causes-analysis` for understanding the "why" of the domain
